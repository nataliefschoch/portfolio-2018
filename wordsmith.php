                I created and designed Wordsmith after discovering there wasn't a simple, clean Chrome extension to help learn vocabulary. The idea is simple: leverage existing SAT word data sets and style the vocabulary word and definitions in elegant typography.

              <p>
                Using the new tab screen in Chrome while browsing the internet is an eye-catching but unobtrusive way to introduce or reinforce vocabulary words into those looking to increase their lexicon. The screen is simple enough to ensure legibility but elegantly designed with subtle variations to help avoid tedium.

            <p>
              Wordsmith is a light-weight tool utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I build the front-end and partnered with Lindsay Grizzard on the back-end connections. She wrote about her experience developing Chrome Extensions in <a target='_blank' href='https://css-tricks.com/control-the-internet-with-chrome-extensions/'>CSS Tricks</a>.
            </p>
            <p class='bold'>Data:</p>
            <p>Wordsmith custom word dataset is a curated and enhanced version based off of a GRE-word dataset. I removed words that we're technically apart of the standardized testing lists, but were commonly known and used. I removed any NSFW or overly grotesk words as to forgo any embarresment at if an unsavory word was to surface at work.</p>

              Building Wordsmith provided a great learning experience in seeing a project through its entire lifespan: from ideation to development. There’s been positive reception by way of reviews and tweets, and I’m excited to continue to launch added functionality and more words!
