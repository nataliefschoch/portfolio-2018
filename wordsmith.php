                Wordsmith is a tool I conceived of and designed after being unsatisifed with the vocabulary tools available in the Chrome Extension store.
                The idea is simple: leverage already existing SAT word data sets and style the vocabulary word and definitions in elegant typography. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Surfacing words during a new tab is the perfect use case for those looking to improve their passive vocabulary. The screen is simple enough to ensure legbibility, but elegantly designed with subtle variations to help avoid tedium.

            <p class='bold'>Tech stack:</p>
            <p>Wordsmith is a light-weight tool utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I build the front-end and partnered with Lindsay Grizzard on the back-end connections. She wrote a great article about her experience in <a target='_blank' href='https://css-tricks.com/control-the-internet-with-chrome-extensions/'>CSS Tricks</a>.</p>
            <p class='bold'>Data:</p>
            <p>Wordsmith custom word dataset is a curated and enhanced version based off of a GRE-word dataset. I removed words that we're technically apart of the standardized testing lists, but were commonly known and used. I removed any NSFW or overly grotesk words as to forgo any embarresment at if an unsavory word was to surface at work.</p>
