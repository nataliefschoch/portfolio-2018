            Hi, I'm Natalie. ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Bay Area native living in San Francisco, CA. I love to work across all graphic mediums but have been playing with code since the days of Myspace and Neopets. I can generally be found listening to too much music, drinking cappuccinos, and overwatering my plant family.

            The best way to contact me is via email, but you can also check out my Dribbble, Linkedin, Medium, and Github. (Or Twitter, but itâ€™s mostly retweets).
