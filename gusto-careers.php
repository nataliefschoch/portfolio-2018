                As a fast-growing company, hiring is one of Gusto's toughest challenges. The careers page is a integral part of that recruiting process since it is the last touch point before a candidate submits their applications.
                In 2018, Gusto invested in redesigning our careers page to ensure it reflected the company's vibrant culture.

            <p>The best thing about a company culture is how multi-faceted it is. For this page, the first thing the team led what what to include and what to not. We worked with Gusto's recruiting team to get a sense of what were the possbilities of features of the page. We determined pretty quickly the page needed to have open positions and updated photography. To make ensure the page also reflected what made Gusto unique, we added diversity and belonging and small business focus, and Gusto testimonials.</p>
