                As a fast-growing company, hiring is one of the toughest challenges Gusto faces. The careers page is an integral part of that recruiting process because it is the last touch point before a candidate submits their applications. In 2018, Gusto invested in redesigning our out-dated careers page to ensure it represented Gusto’s vibrant culture, our values, and our commitment and investment to diversity.

              The primary goal of the redesign was to articulate what makes Gusto unique from all the other tech companies in the space. While Gusto parodies many other companies in regards to benefits and compensation, a key differentiator is our commitment to people and their well-being at work. I worked with the People and Recruiting team to establish the requisite feature list and then partnered with a copywriter to brainstorm how to bring the page to life through visuals and narrative. We determined that actually showing people through photography was the best way to represent Gusto’s culture.

            <p class='bold margin-top-30px padding-bottom-10px'>
              Goals of the redesign:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>1. Show what makes Gusto unique by capturing out company culture.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>2. Spotlighting diversity and belonging.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>3. Improving job application user experience.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class='padding-top-15px'>
              I set up weekly check-ins with the People and Recruiting teams and presented the team’s work to incorporate their feedback and unique perspective. We walked them through three main stages: wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and final designs.

              Two of the primary goals of the redesign were to capture Gusto’s company culture and to showcase our commitment to diversity and belonging.

              I worked with <a href='#'>Colin Price</a>, a talented Oakland-based photographer, to photograph the San Francisco and Denver office. I encouraged imperfections and tried to capture candid moments to reflect the authenticity of the company.

              Gusto has a thriving community of ERGs (employee resource groups) which exist to support, promote, and celebrate a culture or identity. We spotlighted these groups and made accompanying stickers.

            <p>The final goal of the redesign was to improve job application user experience. Although our job applications were listed on a third party software, Greenhouse, we wanted to ensure that finding and applying for a position was an intuitive and seamless experience. I worked with our internal engineering team and Greenhouse’s team to layer additional functionality on top of Greenhouse’s API on the job listing part of the page. In addition, we reskinned the job application page to match Gusto’s branding.</p>
            <p>
              We ultimately increased inbound applications increased by 178% and receieved positive anctedoal reception from the Recruiting team. Additionally and just as importantly, internal Gusties I spoke to felt the page was an accurate representation of the culture.
