                Like many fast-growing tech companies, one of the toughest challenges that Gusto faces is hiring. As the last pre-application touchpoint, the careers page is a critical part of the recruiting process. In 2018, Gusto invested in redesigning its outdated careers page to ensure it represented Gusto’s vibrant culture, values, and commitment and investment to diversity.

              The primary goal of the redesign was to articulate what differentiates Gusto from its competitors. While Gusto matches other companies in regards to benefits and compensation, it’s the company’s commitment to culture, values, and its people that sets it apart.

              I worked with the People team to establish the initial feature list and then partnered with a copywriter to brainstorm how to bring the page to life through visuals and narrative. We walked the People team through three main stages: wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and final designs.

              Gusto has a thriving community of ERGs (employee resource groups) which exist to support, promote, and celebrate a culture or identity. We spotlighted these groups and made accompanying stickers.

              The final goal of the redesign was to improve job application user experience. Although our job applications were listed on third-party software, Greenhouse, we wanted to ensure that finding and applying for a position was an intuitive and seamless experience. I worked with our internal engineering team and Greenhouse’s team to build a custom user experience using Greenhouse’s API. In addition, we reskinned the job application page to match Gusto’s branding.

              We were able to increase inbound applications increased by 178% and received a positive reception from the Recruiting team. Additionally, and just as importantly, internal Gusties I spoke to felt the page was an accurate representation of the culture.
