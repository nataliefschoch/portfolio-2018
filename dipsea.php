              Dipsea is the first audio platform for sexual wellness. It provides short and sexy audio stories made for women. I worked with the Dipsea team to create an onboarding experience for new users and trial subscribers. The goal of the onboarding flow was to educate users, create a high-touch and personalized experience, and increase content discoverability.

                By asking users to answer four simple questions about themselves, we were able to recommend a story personalized to their tastes and preferences.
